# COMP1073 - JavaScript - Assignment 3 - To-do List
## 200385752 - Nhat Mai (Nvi)
### DESCRIPTION
Assemble a simple to-do list application that uses a few simple HTML elements, some CSS,
and JavaScript to handle the functionality. DO NOT COPY IN-CLASS CODE OR CODE FROM
ANY THIRD-PARTY SOURCE – THIS REQUIRES YOUR OWN ORIGINAL WORK (HTML,
CSS, AND JS).

### INSTRUCTIONS
1. Build a simple HTML template for the application (valid HTML, CSS and an external
JavaScript file).
2. Create an `<h1>` element that features the name of your to-do list.
3. Build an `<input>` element that allows someone to type out a to-do item, and a
`<button>` element to add it to the list.
4. Add an event handler that captures the value of the above `<input>` element and creates
a new HTML element that features a checkbox (`<input type=”checkbox”>`), the
text of the new to-do item, and a `<button>` element to delete the to-do.
5. For each to-do item, build an event handler that listens for the change event for the
checkbox – when a todo is checked, the item is added to the Done list 
property, and it is moved to the bottom of the list of to-dos.
6. Also, include an event handler that removes the respective to-do item when a user
clicks on the delete `<button>` element.
### TAKE IT FURTHER
1. Edit the to-do name
2. Added some sounds for the events
3. Show up the edit field when hover the item name
